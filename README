SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Ika;
        use Test::Expects;

        describe 'MessageFilter' => sub {
            my $filter;

            before_each {
                $filter = MessageFilter->new();
            };

            it 'should detect message with NG word' => sub {
                my $filter = MessageFilter->new('foo');
                expect($filter->detect('hello foo'))->ok;
            };
            it 'should detect message with NG word' => sub {
                my $filter = MessageFilter->new('foo');

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Ika is yet another BDD framework for Perl5.

    This module provides pretty output for testing.

    THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE. API MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

FAQ
    Ika?
        This module is dedicated to ikasam_a, a famous Japanese testing
        engineer.

    Why another one?
        This module focused to pretty output. Another modules doesn't
        provide this feature.

    Where is 'should'?
        I think the keyword 'should' is not a core feature of BDD.

Reporters
    Test::Ika provides some reporters.

    The spec mode(default)
    TAP output(it's enabled under $ENV{HARNESS_ACTIVE} is true)

FUNCTIONS
    describe($name, $code)
        Create new Test::Ika::ExampleGroup.

    context
        It's alias of 'describe' function.

    it($name, $code)
        Create new Test::Ika::Example.

    before_all(\&code)
        Register hook.

    before_each(\&code)
        Register hook.

    after_all(\&code)
        Register hook.

    after_each(\&code)
        Register hook.

    runtests()
        Do run test cases immediately.

        Normally, you don't call this method expressly. Test::Ika runs test
        cases on END { } phase.
